This bug occurs when using the Expo Constants API to access device-specific information such as device year class.  The issue arises when the app is running in a simulator or emulator, where the `Constants.deviceYearClass` value might be undefined or incorrect, causing crashes or unexpected behavior.  The code might expect a value from the API but receives undefined, leading to runtime errors.
